With a strong foundation in frontend technologies and a growing expertise in backend development, I'm dedicated to crafting innovative digital solutions that leave a lasting impact.

**About Me**

I'm a proactive learner and an advocate for staying updated with the latest trends in web development. My journey began with mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, allowing me to create responsive and visually appealing web interfaces. I've honed my skills in CSS frameworks such as Bulma and Bootstrap to bring sleek designs to life.

My curiosity doesn't stop at the frontend. I'm currently immersed in learning backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize. My goal is to become a versatile full-stack developer, capable of creating dynamic, data-driven web applications that provide seamless user experiences.

I take pride in the projects I've worked on, and I'm excited to showcase a few of them here. From "Streamly!" - a movie and TV show finder - to various other applications that demonstrate my skills in both frontend and backend development, each project has been a step forward in my journey.

**Skills**

Frontend development is where I shine, with expertise in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and the use of popular frameworks like Bootstrap and Bulma. On the backend, I'm working with Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and more, expanding my capabilities to create robust and interactive applications.

**Learning Journey**

Web development is a field that's constantly evolving, and I'm committed to staying ahead of the curve. I thrive on challenges and new opportunities to learn, and I'm excited to collaborate with fellow developers and teams to create solutions that matter.
